**Blockchain-Based KYC Processes: A Decentralized Approach**

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in blockchain technology is a promising concept, however it also presents several challenges and considerations that need to be addressed. Because 
swarm learning processes shares insights rather than source data, security risks and government regulations. The learnings derived from protected data can be safely shared 
across organizations. 

In traditional KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, a centralized approach may introduce security risks and latency concerns in machine learning models.  Blockchain technology holds tremendous promise, it also presents several challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.



**Advantages of Blockchain-Based KYC Processes**

Blockchain-based KYC processes offer several benefits over traditional methods. Some of these advantages include: 

*   Resource Management 
*   Scalability
    efficiency without introducing security risks and latency concerns.
*   Education and awareness of the use of blockchain-based KYC
